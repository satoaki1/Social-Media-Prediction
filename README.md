# Social-Media-Prediction

**The Case Study:**</br>
This case study investigates the use of machine learning to predict total conversion from a social media ad campaign. The dataset contains 1143 observations in 11 variables.
</br>

**Metadata:**</br>
| **Attributes** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| age | Age of the person to whom the ad is shown |
| gender | Gender of the person to whom the ad is shown |
| interest | A code specifying the category to which the person's interest belongs (interests are as mentioned in the person's Facebook public profile) |
| Impressions | The number of times the ad was shown |
| Clicks | Number of clicks on for that ad |
| Spent | Amount paid by company XYZ to Facebook, to show that ad |
| Total conversion | Total number of people who enquired about the product after seeing the ad |
</br>

**Objective**</br>
The objective of this case study is to develop an optimized regression model to predict total conversion. The model should be able to accurately predict total conversion for new ad campaigns, based on the features that are available.
</br>

**Approach**</br>
The following approach will be used to develop the optimized regression model:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be performed to understand the distribution of the variables and the relationship between the variables.
- A baseline linear regression model will be trained to predict total conversion.
- The performance of the baseline model will be evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- More complex regression models, such as polynomial regression, will be trained and evaluated.
- The best performing regression model will be selected, tuned, optimized and used to predict total conversion for new ad campaigns.
</br>

**Benefits**</br>
The development of an optimized regression model to predict total conversion will provide the following benefits:
- The model can be used to identify the ad campaigns that are most likely to be successful.
- The model can be used to optimize the ad campaigns to improve total conversion.
- The model can be used to predict the total conversion for new ad campaigns, before they are launched.
This case study will demonstrate the use of machine learning to solve a real-world problem. The optimized regression model that is developed in this case study can be used by businesses to improve their social media ad campaigns and increase their sales.
